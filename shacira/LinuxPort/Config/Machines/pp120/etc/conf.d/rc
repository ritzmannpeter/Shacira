# RC_NET_STRICT_CHECKING allows some flexibility with the 'net' service.
# The following values are allowed:
#  none  - The 'net' service is always considered up.
#  no    - This basically means that at least one net.* service besides net.lo
#          must be up.  This can be used by notebook users that have a wifi and
#          a static nic, and only wants one up at any given time to have the
#          'net' service seen as up.
#  lo    - This is the same as the 'no' option, but net.lo is also counted.
#          This should be useful to people that do not care about any specific
#          interface being up at boot.
#  yes   - For this ALL network interfaces MUST be up for the 'net' service to
#          be considered up.

# RC_VOLUME_ORDER allows you to specify, or even remove the volume setup
# for various volume managers (MD, EVMS2, LVM, DM, etc).  Note that they are

# RC_BOOTLOG will generate a log of the boot messages shown on the console.  
# Useful for headless machines or debugging.  You need to emerge the 
# app-admin/showconsole package for this to work.  Note that this probably
# won't work correctly with boot splash.

# RC_USE_FSTAB allows you to override the default mount options for the

# is the new way for selecting ramfs/tmpfs/etc... for udev mounting.

RC_USE_FSTAB="no"

# RC_USE_CONFIG_PROFILE allows you to have different /etc/conf.d files
# based on your runlevel - if a conf.d file for your profile does not exist
# then we try and use the default one.
# To enable runlevel selection at boot, append "softlevel=foobar" to your
# kernel line to change to the foobar runlevel. Or "rc foobar" at the command
# prompt.

RC_USE_CONFIG_PROFILE="no"

# RC_FORCE_AUTO tries its best to prevent user interaction during the boot and 
# shutdown process.  For example, fsck will automatically be run or volumes 
# remounted to create proper directory trees.  This feature can be dangerous 
# and is meant ONLY for headless machines where getting a physical console 
# hooked up is a huge pita.

RC_FORCE_AUTO="no"

# Use this variable to control the /dev management behavior.
#  auto   - let the scripts figure out what's best at boot
#  devfs  - use devfs (requires sys-fs/devfsd)
#  udev   - use udev (requires sys-fs/udev)
#  static - let the user manage /dev

RC_DEVICES="auto"

# UDEV OPTION:
# Set to "yes" if you want to save /dev to a tarball on shutdown
